        <p>Spam Musubi is a simple and filling recipe that needs about 4 simple things.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients needed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spam (as the name implies)</li>
            <li>White rice</li>
            <li>Nori sheet</li>
            <li>Some form of sauce (I use teriyaki)</li>
            <li>Not needed but suggested: Musubi press (You can also use your leftover spam can!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to make:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make some rice! I'm gonna assume you know how to already do this.</li>
            <li>Now what you want to do is slice your Spam into slices like the image above.</li>
            <li>Use medium heat on your skillet, and throw your slices on until they're nice and crispy.</li>
            <li>After you crisp both sides of the Spam, add your Teriyaki sauce.</li>
            <li>Let them get nice and coated and then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Next we line some plastic wrap into our Musubi press.</li>
            <li>Finally start to layer your rice into the press, after that add a slice of spam!</li>
            <li>Add one more layer of rice, and press the layered mixture together.</li>
            <li>Finally, cut your nori into strips long enough to wrap around your Musubi.</li>
            <li>After you wrap them, your Musubi is ready to eat.</li>
        
        </ol>

        <p>With one just one can of spam you could probably make about 4 Musubi. That leaves you leftovers or some to share!</p>
        <h3>Hope you enjoy your sweet, savory, and salty snack!</h3>
