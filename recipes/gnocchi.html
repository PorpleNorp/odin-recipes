        <h2>Tasty, and Fluffy Potatoe Noodles</h2>
        
        <p>"What is in gnocchi?" you might ask. Gnocchi is nothing more than a mix of flour, 
        egg and boiled potatoes.</p>

        <p>While it takes a bit of a time commitment, 
        gnocchi are easy and cheap to make. 
        Taste wise they are light, filling and go well with about any sauce!
        My personal favorite is to mix it with pesto as this creates a savory dish.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients needed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large rustic potatoes</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1.5-2.5 cups of flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Now heres how to make this wonderful dish!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First step is to get your potatoes boiled until nice and soft (30mins-1h).</li>
            <li>Take them out and let them <em>cool until it is safe to touch</em> (<strong>don't get burned!</strong>).</li>
            <li>After cool peel away the skin and then rice them with a fork.</li>
            
            <li>Add your egg and mix it in well. Then a dash of salt.</li>
            <li>Make sure to get a gentle amount of flour on the counter! <em>This keeps the dough from sticking</em></li>
            <li>Start to slowly add your flour in. You can stop when the dough is nice and bouncy!</li>
            <p>(You will get a feel for how much flour you need, there isn't really an exact amount.)</p>
            
            <li>Once the dough is formed, roll it into a nice ball. Proceed to cut it into quarters.</li>
            <li>Take a quarter of the dough and roll it out into a nice skinny tube! Like this!</li>

            <li> After your big noodle tube is formed, go ahead and cut them in into 1" noodles.</li>
            <li>If you want to cook them now (You can place the dough in the fridge for a bit also!)
            just boil them in salted water and wait until they float to the top.</li>
            <li>Drain 'em out of the water, add your sauce, and thats all!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A thing to note is you can always freeze any excess dough you might have left over</p>
        Because this dough recipe makes <strong>A LOT OF NOODLES!</strong>
        <h2>Hope you enjoy this recipe!</h2>
